# Code Diary

This is an in-progress and incomplete collection of my notes. Previously my note taking was more haphazard, and this is an attempt to organise my knowledge more systematically.

## Learning Workflow
Broadly, this is my current workflow for learning new stuff:

1. Collect questions related to a particular subject over a period of weeks/months.
   - Everytime I'm confused about something, I try to note what exactly it is that I **don't** know. Turning diffuse "confusion" into a concrete question is a useful practice.
   - I'll often make a new file for a subject (e.g. "SQL query plans") which at first consists only of related questions.
1. Do a deep dive into answering questions around a particular subject, while making notes.
   - I prioritise areas that come up all the time.
   - This process often takes several hours, and I try to follow relevant rabbit-holes if they lead to greater big-picture understanding.
   - For example: "a JOINS connects two or more SQL tables. Hang on, what exactly is the definition of a table? Do I understand that properly?".
   - This kind of deep dive is one of my favourite things about being a software developer - understanding a system better, and noticing connections between previously disparate phenomena, is very satisfying.
1. Commit important things to memory using spaced repetition software 
   - If I'm confident that the notes are important and likely to be relevant to me for a long time, I'll memorise them using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

## Inspiration

[This Semicolon & Sons video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tarmCEHfGa0&ab_channel=Semicolon%26Sons) inspired me to arrange my notes more systematically.
