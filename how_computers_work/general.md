# General

## Questions
- What does it mean that diskspace is magnetic?
- How do you "increase" CPU?
- What metrics would tell you that you need more CPU as opposed to RAM?

## Terminology
- _RAM_: Random Access Memory, aka memory. 
- _HDD_: Hard Disk Drive, aka diskspace.
- _SDD_: Solid State Drive, also aka diskspace.
- _Swap space_: Use disk space as RAM when RAM is full.
- _Virtual memory_: Total RAM + total swap space

- _CPU_: Central Processing Unit


## CPU


## RAM vs Diskspace
- HDDs and SSDs are both forms of diskspace storage.
  - SSDs are much faster, and now the default form of storage on high-end laptops (eg Macbook Pros)
- If you're running out of memory, you should close open apps etc.
- If you're running out of diskspace, you should delete some files or upgrade storage space.

## Swapping / Swap space / Paging
- Disk space that is reserved as a RAM substitute
- the Kernel takes data (usually less-recently used) that's stored in RAM, moves ("swaps") it to the disk, to free up RAM
