# Subjects to Research

- Networking
  - What's a packet?
  - What exactly is a networking protocol? What are the purposes of the main ones? (UDP, IP, FTP etc)
  - what's a port? Why does port 80 come up a lot?

- When an array is sorted
- Writing to memory: When we say a value is written to a specific memory address, that means that the memory address will contain a binary representation of that value, is that right? What about when we're writing something more complicated than a string or a number - say a hash key that contains a serialized Ruby object.
